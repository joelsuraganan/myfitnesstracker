# MyFitnessTracker 💪

MyFitnessTracker is a full-stack fitness web application built for my senior capstone project at Madonna University. It allows users to track workouts, meals, and body weight, while also offering educational content on exercises, foods, and supplements.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of MyFitnessTracker is to create an intuitive, beginner-friendly fitness tracking platform that supports both anonymous and registered users. The app is built using Django and Bootstrap, and it runs locally.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Anonymous Users
- View popular lifts and watch how-to videos
- Explore healthy foods and their nutritional benefits
- Read about common supplements and their purposes

### 🔐 Registered Users
- Log daily workouts (exercise, reps, sets)
- Track daily nutrition (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
- Monitor weekly weight

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Authentication:** Django's built-in user model
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
